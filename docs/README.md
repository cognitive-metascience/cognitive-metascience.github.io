# Cognitive Metascience Lab
## Part of the [Section for Logic and Cognitive Science, Polish Academy of Sciences ](https://ifispan.pl/en/filozofia/logic-and-cognitive-science/)

The goal of cognitive metascience is to unite cognitive science, philosophy of science, digital philosophy of science, and digital humanities to explore how researchers reflect on their scientific practice and provide normative guidance during the credibility crisis.

We're using the insights of these large research traditions to study the actual scientific practice. This way, we can enrich considerations required to make valid normative claims that could pave the way towards solving the crisis, especially regarding theory development and assessment.

Here are some resources that we have made available recently.

## Corpora

### Peer Review corpora — open data sets

Here are some corpora we released:

* eLife Open Peer Review Corpus, <https://doi.org/10.18150/FKPEQN>
* PLoS Open Peer Review Corpus, <https://doi.org/10.18150/KZHVGE>
* MDPI Open Peer Review Corpus, <https://doi.org/10.18150/D5L2EK>
* MDPI Open Peer Review Corpus 2 (much bigger), <https://doi.org/10.18150/SHKP7B>

The MDPI data set in the version 2 is much bigger – the crawler we used was upgraded to find more data. It is probably the biggest open peer review corpus out there. If you are using our datasets, please cite them using the DOI number.

## Software

A pure [Python open source reimplementation of word sketches ](https://github.com/cognitive-metascience/word_sketch)(collocation) for corpora of arbitrary size, just the kind you would expect in [SketchEngine](https://www.sketchengine.eu/). However, by using our code, you can:

-   ensure reproducibility (anyone can run the same code using your data),

-   work with datasets of arbitrary size (even if your institution has very limited access to SketchEngine),

-   run word sketches in a Python Notebook (think of Constellate).

Methodological and Metaphilosophical Issues*, Piotr Stalmaszczyk (ed.), Brill / mentis. Preprint: <https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/a2v4u>

> In this forthcoming chapter we argue for the use of empirical evidence from digital philosophy in the practice of conceptual engineering, and provide a proof-of-principle by discovering an engineering the concept of 'predictive understanding' hitherto overlooked by philosophers working on understanding, but present in scientists' discourse.

> This paper presents the cognitive metascience approach, in particular the account of scientific theories in terms of cognitive artifacts whose contents are not fully accountable for in terms of data. The Polish translation of the paper was published in the same journal: <https://doi.org/10.31648/przegldpsychologiczny.9459>

> In this commentary to Yarkoni's paper, we argue that psychology needs more explicit theory development, which can start from fairly mundane claims.

> This paper describes the conceptual foundations of cognitive metascience: scientific representations are cognitive artifacts whose function we should study across multiple dimensions. A short glimpse on the virtues of models through corpora analysis is given.*

> We claim that low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability and reports of computational studies should remain selective and include all and only relevant bits of code.

## Funded projects

[Wiktor Rorot](https://wiktor.rorot.pl/)'s project "Investigation of the use of the concept *communication* in biology and cognitive sciences" has been funded by the National Science Center. Under my supervision, he will study the notion of communication and related notions in life sciences, by relying on digital philosophy of science. The [popular description of the project ](https://www.ncn.gov.pl/sites/default/files/listy-rankingowe/2022-03-15-ako9z8/streszczenia/558141-en.pdf)is also available on the funder site.

## Student projects


Are you a student in the Cognitive Science program at the University of Warsaw looking for a new project? Work with me on projects related to cognitive metascience, using language technology and digital philosophy of science. Contact me if you're interested.

Research stays for students in my lab are also available.
